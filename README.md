### React App with Tailwind CSS

This React component is the main structure of a webpage, styled using Tailwind CSS. It imports several child components (`Hero`, `Services`, `Banner`, `Banner2`, `Subscribe`, and `Footer`) to compose the layout. The `App` component is wrapped in a `main` element, which uses Tailwind CSS classes like:

- `overflow-x-hidden`: To prevent horizontal scrolling.
- `bg-white`: Sets the background color to white.
- `text-dark`: Applies dark-colored text.

#### Components:
- **Hero**: Represents the hero section, typically used to highlight important content with a large image or heading.
- **Services**: Displays the services provided.
- **Banner & Banner2**: Adds call-to-action or informational sections.
- **Subscribe**: A section for users to subscribe or join a mailing list.
- **Footer**: The bottom part of the page with additional links or contact information.
